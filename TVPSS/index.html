    <ul><li>TVPSS ROOM was built in 2021. Firstly, it was a frog class. Students used to learn some Chinese, English, and Malay knowledge in the frog class. In 2020, our new principal, BOO CHENG CHOON, started to plan to build a TVPSS Room. In 2021, the TVPSS Room had been finished building.</li></ul>
